Dataset used: "20 newsgroups"

## Dataset
For dataset I used the famous "20 Newsgroups" dataset.

The data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. 
You can find the dataset freely here[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups].
